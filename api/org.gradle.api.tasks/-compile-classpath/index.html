<p>
<p>Marks a property as specifying a Java compile classpath for a task. Attaching this annotation to a property means that changes that do not affect the API of the classes in classpath will be ignored. The following kinds of changes to the classpath will be ignored:</p>
 <ul> <li>Changes to the path of jar or top level directories.</li>
 <li>Changes to timestamps and the order of entries in Jars.</li>
 <li>Changes to resources and Jar manifests, including adding or removing resources.</li>
 <li>Changes to private class elements, such as private fields, methods and inner classes.</li>
 <li>Changes to code, such as method bodies, static initializers and field initializers (except for constants).</li>
 <li>Changes to debug information, for example when a change to a comment affects the line numbers in class debug information.</li>
 <li>Changes to directories, including directory entries in Jars.</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>This annotation should be attached to the getter method in Java or the property in Groovy. Annotations on setters or just the field in Java are ignored.</p>
 
<p><strong>Note:</strong> to stay compatible with versions prior to Gradle 3.4, classpath properties need to be annotated with @InputFiles as well.</p>
