<p>Creates a new Gradle runner. 
<p> The runner requires a Gradle distribution (and therefore a specific version of Gradle) in order to execute builds. This method will find a Gradle distribution, based on the filesystem location of this class. That is, it is expected that this class is loaded from a Gradle distribution. </p>
<p> When using the runner as part of tests <em>being executed by Gradle</em> (i.e. a build using the <code>gradleTestKit()</code> dependency), this means that the same distribution of Gradle that is executing the tests will be used by runner returned by this method. </p>
<p> When using the runner as part of tests <em>being executed by an IDE</em>, this means that the same distribution of Gradle that was used when importing the project will be used.</p>
